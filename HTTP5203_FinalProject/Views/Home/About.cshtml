                When a visitor comes to the website, their location is being detected automatically and shown on the map. In case the user feels he/she is at a different
                location, they can adjust their current location accordingly using the search box. The website will also provide the current weather conditions at their
                current location.
            </div>
            <div>
                If the visitor is in Toronto, they can decide to view the roadblocks that are around them within a parametrized radius as they wish for. Otherwise, they
                can search for their destination location and while showing the route, the website will display any roadblocks that are found on that route.
